# Testing-Volatility-Models-using-Value-at-Risk-Backtests

A comparative analysis of various volatility models using the Value-at-Risk
concept. Value-at-Risk is a risk measure which aims to capture the minimum loss
given a certain probability. Although the concept has been widely criticized, 
its ease of use and testing is an attractive quality. The study uses the data from
S&P500 and EUROSTOXX indices, which is then used to compare 4 different models of 
volatility. The analysis shows that EGARCH and GJR-GARCH models perform best out
of the selected models for the given samples of return data.
